> 👋 Hello! My name is Kaden, but you can call me `webcrawls` online. I'm OK with either :)

> 👤 I'm a 19y/o from 🇨🇦, interested in a variety of topics surrounding software development, game design, and anything creative.

> 🌐 I enjoy full-stack development, favouring the Svelte ecosystem, and have written numerous backend systems in languages such as Java, Go, and Python.

> 🎨 Tired of looking at code? Check out my [music](), [art]() or find me on [Twitter](#).

## Archived Projects

> 🗃️ I've started (and stopped) working on a lot of projects. Here are some cool ones!

- [github.com/navy-cafe](#) - A collection of utilities for running a Minecraft server. Will hopefully clean up one day.
- [startmc/startmc.sh](#) - A website which generates a shell script to run a Minecraft server. Has since been beautifully outdone by [flags.sh](https://flags.sh/)!
